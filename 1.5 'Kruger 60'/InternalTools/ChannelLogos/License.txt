The Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express license terms located at **%Program Files%\Microsoft SQL Server Compact Edition\v4.0** apply to your use of them, except that the components listed below may be used for commercial hosting services when used in conjunction with the software.

         - TXT Files. You may copy and distribute the object code form of code listed in REDIST.TXT files.
         - Third Party Distribution. You may permit distributors of your programs to copy and distribute the Distributable Code as part of those programs.

      2. **Distribution Requirements. For any Distributable Code you distribute, you must**

         - add significant primary functionality to it in your programs;
         - for any Distributable Code having a filename extension of .lib, distribute only the results of running such Distributable Code through a linker with your program;
         - distribute Distributable Code included in a setup program only as part of that setup program without modification;
         - require distributors and external end users to agree to terms that protect it at least as much as this agreement;
         - display your valid copyright notice on your programs; and
         - indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys&#39; fees, related to the distribution or use of your programs.

      3. **Distribution Restrictions. You may not**

         - alter any copyright, trademark or patent notice in the Distributable Code;
         - use Microsoft's trademarks in your programs' names or in a way that suggests your programs come from or are endorsed by Microsoft;
         - distribute Distributable Code to run on a platform other than the Windows platform;
         - include Distributable Code in malicious, deceptive or unlawful programs; or
         - modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, that
            - the code be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or
            - others have the right to modify it.

3. **SCOPE OF LICENSE.** The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not

   - work around any technical limitations in the software;

6. **EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.** The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see [www.microsoft.com/exporting](http://www.microsoft.com/exporting).

7. **SUPPORT SERVICES.** Because this software is provided "as is," we may not provide support services for it.

8. **ENTIRE AGREEMENT.** This agreement, and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

9. **APPLICABLE LAW.**

  - **United States.** If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.
  - **Outside the United States.** If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.

10. **LEGAL EFFECT.** This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your country if the laws of your country do not permit it to do so.

11. **DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.** THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS-IS." YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE.

      - claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

    It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
